Prerequisites
-------------
PCSC/Ada is written in Ada, so you need to have GNAT (GNU Ada Translator)
installed to compile PCSC/Ada. For the unit tests to work, you further need to
have Ahven installed (see 'Installation').
GNAT is available for most distributions, make sure you have gcc version 4.1 or
later installed.

Installation
------------
For PCSC/Ada to compile, you need the following libraries/frameworks installed:

* GNAT:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnat/gnat.html[]

* Ahven (Test-Framework):
  http://home.gna.org/ahven/[]

TIP: with Debian, typing `apt-get install gnat-4.3 libahven-dev` will do the job.

The installation of PCSC/Ada is quite easy and straightforward. Just type
in the following commands, you must be root to install the library system wide.

.................
  $ tar -xzf libpcscada-{revision}.tar.bz2
  $ cd libpcscada-{revision}
  $ make
  $ make PREFIX=/usr/local install

If no `PREFIX` is specified, `$(HOME)/libraries` is used as install destination.
