PCSC/Ada TODO List
===================

- Add preferred protocols to SCard.Connect procedure
- Support 'or' operation for SCard.Connect preferred protocols
- Add default options or null/empty types for in params.
- Improve SCard.Transmit and corresponding buffer handling.
  * Remove Recv_Len param.
  * Allocate memory for buffer inside the binding, client does not
    know the required size before the call returns.
  * For that we need Handles and Free() procedures.
- Provide To_Byte_Set function which returns a Byte_Set from a String.
  * e.g. "16 3B 12 28"
- Use 'private with' for PCSC.Thin in thick binding.
  * A thick binding type for Thin.Byte is needed.
