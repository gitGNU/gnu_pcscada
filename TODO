* Support multiple Current_States Readerstate
* Correct handling of Empty_Reader_Status_Set in To_C (Reader_Status_Set)
* Add preferred protocols to SCard.Connect procedure
* Support 'or' operation for SCard.Connect preferred protocols
* Add default options or null/empty types for in params.
* Improve SCard.Transmit and corresponding buffer handling.
  o Remove Recv_Len param.
  o Allocate memory for buffer inside the binding, client does not
    know the required size before the call returns.
  o For that we need Handles and Free() procedures.
* Provide To_Byte_Set function which returns a Byte_Set from a String.
  o e.g. "16 3B 12 28"
* Fix valgrinds "Syscall param write(buf) points to uninitialised byte(s)"
  error for SCard Control procedure.
* Use better type names for Reader_Status, Reader_States.
  o Confusing : similar names
* Use 'private with' for PCSC.Thin in thick binding.
  o A thick binding type for Thin.Byte is needed.
